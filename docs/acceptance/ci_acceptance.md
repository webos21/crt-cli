# GitHub CI Acceptance

This record owns what the CI driver and workflow have actually been run against. The design and the
procedure are in the [development guide](../guides/development.md#continuous-integration); open work is in
[TODO](../../TODO.md#github-ci). A passing local rehearsal is not a GitHub-hosted run.

## Linux/x86_64 local rehearsal of the driver (2026-11-10)

Scope: `tools/ci_bootstrap.py` on one native host with the real public downloads, no workflow engine.

| Item | Exact identity |
| --- | --- |
| Source under test | CLI `0cae8c8bc1fee02a31baf230aba703460fe1afa3` plus this change's uncommitted CI files and the `bin/` removal (product, test and manifest sources are unchanged) |
| Bootstrap CLI | Published `v0.1.0-preview.20261110.linux-x86_64.1`, archive SHA-256 `ad43afbf...1383` (matches the release `SHA256SUMS`), executable `a8fb76a4...a43a` |
| SDK | Public `v0.0.1-preview.20261110.3`, acquired through `github-release` redirects; installed content `36623957...2b3f` equals the pin |
| Host tools | Ubuntu 26.04.1, Ubuntu clang/LLVM 21.1.8 at `/usr/lib/llvm-21/bin`, GNU readelf 2.46, Python 3.14.4 |
| Command | `python3 tools/ci_bootstrap.py --work <new-dir> --llvm-bin /usr/lib/llvm-21/bin` (private `HOME` inside `--work`) |

| Gate | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Pin check, version, `sdk acquire` of the pinned SDK from GitHub | Pass (3.8 s) |
| Stage 1 (bootstrap CLI, explicit `configure` to the installed SDK + its stored contract) | 21 executed / 0 reused (84 s) |
| Suites on the stage-1 executable: native / archive / sdk-store / port-recipe | 901 / 221 / 114 / 141 checks pass, none skipped (same counts as the published Preview record) |
| Stage 2 (stage-1 copy, first build with `--sdk`, rebuilt at stage 1's path) | 21 executed / 0 reused; unchanged rebuild 0 executed |
| Stage 1 vs stage 2 bytes | Identical, SHA-256 `7f622894...ca61` |
| Import audit | No `DT_NEEDED`, `RPATH` or `RUNPATH`; interpreter `/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2` only |
| Executable alone (no SDK store, empty `PATH`, fresh home): `--version`, `--help`, `doctor --bootstrap` | Pass for both stages, identical checks |
| Negative controls: wrong bootstrap digest; test unclassified in `pins.json`; test in both lists | Each fails with its own message, exit 1 |

Findings fixed during the rehearsal (the first two attempts failed, both in the driver, not the product):

- `native-test` reads `sdk_root` and `sdk_contract` from the project's `.crt/local.json` because it drives explicit
  `--sdk-root`/`--sdk-contract` flows. A first-build store binding deliberately keeps no machine path, so stage 1 is bound by
  `configure` against the store directory and the contract stored beside it.
- `__FILE__` and `-g` debug info embed the absolute source path, so stages built in different directories never match
  byte for byte. Stage 2 is therefore rebuilt at stage 1's path; the earlier "different bytes" result was this, not drift.
- The bare-run check reused one directory for both stages; it is now per stage.

## First GitHub-hosted run (2026-11-10)

Workflow run [`42773306405`](https://github.com/webos21/crt-cli/actions/runs/42773306405) on commit `d6578cc50c7e4812a66d9cba5c566a6e614c54ee`
(images `ubuntu-24.04` 20261101.360, `macos-15`, `windows-2022`). Logs and receipts were downloaded from the uploaded artifacts.

| Leg | Result |
| --- | --- |
| macOS/arm64 | **Pass, every stage.** Public macOS Dev SDK `v0.0.1-preview.20261110.macos.1` (content `e3dc7fb1...bac8`) acquired from GitHub; suites native 941 / archive 221 / sdk-store 114 / port-recipe 141, none skipped; stage 2 cold 21/0 and warm 0; imports `libSystem` only; SDK-free run passes. Stage 1 and stage 2 differ byte-wise (cause not investigated; the Preview record saw identical code and data), which the driver reports without gating. `native-test` took 841 s |
| Linux/x86_64 | Bootstrap, LLVM 21 apt install, SDK acquisition, stage 1 (21/0) pass. `native-test` fails in `variant-cxx-shared-library`: `greeting-test: symbol lookup error: undefined symbol: calloc, version GLIBC_2.2.5`. Later stages did not run (the driver stopped at the first failed suite; it now continues) |
| Windows/x64 | Bootstrap, LLVM 22.1.8 choco install, Windows SDK discovery, SDK acquisition, stage 1 (21/0) pass. `native-test` aborts at start: `mkdtemp failed` |

**Windows cause (driver).** The suite takes its scratch root from `TMPDIR`, then `TEMP`, then `/tmp`; the CLI forwards only `TMPDIR` to
children, and the driver set `TMPDIR` on POSIX hosts only. Windows has no `/tmp`. The driver now sets it everywhere. Not yet re-run on GitHub.

**Linux cause (producer side, reproduced locally).** The failing binary is not host-specific: the executable built on the Ubuntu 26.04 rehearsal
host (glibc 2.43, where it passes) fails identically under Ubuntu 24.04's glibc 2.39 loader. Its dynamic section needs only the SDK's
`ld-linux-x86-64.so.2` stub, `libc.so` (soname of CRT's libc, versions `CRT_1.0`), `libc++`, `libc++abi`, `libunwind`, `libm` and `libdl`; there is no
`GLIBC_*` version need. `LD_DEBUG=symbols,bindings` shows the host loader itself looking up `calloc` across those SDK libraries, and CRT's `libc.so`
defines only `calloc@@CRT_1.0`. This is consistent with the glibc loader re-binding its malloc family to the first C library in scope by the version
`GLIBC_2.2.5` (a reading of glibc behavior, not verified against its source here). The C variants, which run before the failing one in the suite, pass on 24.04; the Preview record notes that `link_c` uses static CRT libraries,
so the C++ shared-runtime path is the one that loads CRT's `libc.so` beside the host loader (inferred, not separately confirmed). This is the same area as the open "Linux C shared SDK mode" exclusion
and belongs to the CRT producer; the CLI is not changed to hide it. A producer-side fix needs its own reproducer and review.

Reproducer without Docker (needs `bwrap`; `ubuntu-base` SHA-256 from the release `SHA256SUMS`):

```text
curl -fsSL https://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-base/releases/24.04/release/ubuntu-base-24.04.5-base-amd64.tar.gz -o base.tar.gz
echo "e77b6f10c2590cef872b33ee9f635a0e3fd1f57fb074c0e52b5c7f56147a0c86  base.tar.gz" | sha256sum -c -
mkdir root && tar -xzf base.tar.gz -C root --no-same-owner --exclude='dev/*'
ln -sf ../lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 root/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
# build any C++ shared-runtime project with the Linux Dev SDK, then run its executable inside glibc 2.39:
bwrap --unshare-all --bind root / --proc /proc --dev /dev --ro-bind <work> <work> --clearenv --setenv PATH /nonexistent <work>/variant/out/native/greeting-test
```

The reproducer project is `crt-cli new variant --language cxx --kind shared-library`; its `greeting-test` is the failing executable. The same
executable runs on glibc 2.43.

## Not run

- On GitHub-hosted images the Linux and Windows legs have not passed. Linux is blocked by the producer-side loader gap above;
  Windows needs a re-run with the `TMPDIR` fix, and its later stages (import audit, SDK-free run) have not executed there.
- The Linux, macOS and Windows driver paths ran on hosted images up to the points recorded above; Python 3.12, `actions/*` at
  their pinned commits, the LLVM 21 apt install and artifact upload worked on Linux.
- Input-gated port suites, redirect/transport replays, Linux/aarch64 and Windows/arm64 are not covered.
- Publisher authentication stays `not_verified`: pins authenticate the bytes, the runner's system roots only protect transport.
